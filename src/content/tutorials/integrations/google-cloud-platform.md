Streaming data from Particle devices into Google Cloud Platform creates
countless opportunities to add intelligence and robustness to your IoT
product. Here are some examples of things you could do with Particle +
Google Cloud Platform:

- Store data from a fleet of devices in a durable, long-term hosted
  database
- Combine data sources from an entire fleet into unified data flows that
  provide product-wide business intelligence
- Take action in the physical world based on results of predictive 
  analysis on a historical data set

Google's Cloud Platform is comprised of <a
href="https://cloud.google.com/products/" target="_blank">dozens of
products & services</a>,
providing you with a variety of potential IoT applications.

Some of the most relevant Google Cloud Platform products to use with Particle are:
- <a href="https://cloud.google.com/datastore/" target="_blank">Cloud Datastore</a>: A highly-scalable NoSQL database for your web and mobile applications
- <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/" target="_blank">BigQuery</a>: A fast, economical and fully managed data warehouse for large-scale data analytics
- <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql/" target="_blank">SQL</a>: A fully managed MySQL database service
- <a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/" target="_blank">Cloud Dataflow</a>: A fully-managed cloud service and programming model for batch and streaming big data processing
- <a href="https://cloud.google.com/prediction/" target="_blank">Prediction API</a>: Machine learning to analyze your data and make predictions

Many of these products relate to data storage. For more information on finding the right data storage option for your particular use case, check out
the docs on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage-options/" target="_blank">choosing a storage option</a>.
This tutorial will focus on the first example use case: storing data from
Particle devices into Google Cloud Platform Datastore.

## Preconfiguration in Google Cloud Platform

Regardless of which Google Cloud Platform product(s) you'd like to use,
streaming data into Google Cloud Platform requires an entry point.
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview"
target="_blank">Google Cloud Pub/Sub</a> provides a scalable,
flexible and reliable entry point for Particle device data into
Google Cloud Platform.

<img src="/assets/images/Particle+GCP-architecture.png" alt="Particle and Google Cloud Platform architecture diagram"/>
<p class="caption">Device data gets routed through the Particle Cloud into Google Cloud Pub/Sub. You can then use that data in
any number of Google Cloud Platform products.</p>

The Particle cloud will *publish* device data to a Pub/Sub *topic*.
Once inside, Google Cloud Platform, any number of *subscribers* can listen for
messages sent to the topic, and relay them to other Google Cloud
Platform products & services. Once you have enabled the Google Cloud Platform integration,
the Particle Cloud will begin listening for Particle publishes with a specific event name from your
fleet of devices, and forward the data payload onto your Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic.

Before setting up the integration in Particle, there are a few pre-configuration steps that you
must do inside Google Cloud Platform. These instructions are also included in the Particle Console
when you enable the Google Cloud Platform integration.

### Sign up for a Google Cloud Platform Account

If you don't already have one, you'll need to sign up for a Google Cloud Platform Account to use this integration.

Visit the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/free-trial/" target="_blank">Google Cloud Platform signup page</a>. Click the "Try it Free" button, and enter the requested information.
Upon signup, you will be enrolled in a 60-day free trial of the service, with $300 in Google Cloud Platform credit.

You can use the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/" target="_blank">Google Cloud Platform Pricing Calculator</a>
to estimate costs of any Google Cloud Platform product.

### Create a Google Cloud Platform Project

In your Google Cloud Platform console, find the project dropdown in the top navigation bar, and select "Create project."
Then, give your project a name. When you're done, click "Create."

<img src="/assets/images/gcp-create-project.png" class="full-width" alt="Create a Google Cloud Platform project"/>

### Create a Pub/Sub Topic with the correct permissions

#### Navigate to Pub/Sub

Click the hamburger menu icon in the top navigation bar. Then, from the slideout menu, select "Pub/Sub" from the list of Google Cloud Platform products.

<img src="/assets/images/gcp-find-pub-sub.png" class="full-width" alt="Navigate to Pub/Sub"/>

#### Create a Topic

If this is your first time using Pub/Sub, you will need to enable the Pub/Sub API before you can create a topic. Once the API is enabled for your account, click on the "Create topic" button from the Pub/Sub dashboard. Then, give your topic a name. Google automatically prefixes your topic name to ensure that you will publish to the right place.

<img src="/assets/images/gcp-create-topic.png" class="full-width" alt="Create a Google Cloud Platform project"/>

#### Give Particle Permission to Publish to your Topic

Once created, check the checkbox next to your topic name, and click on the "Permissions" button. Then, in the "Add members" box, paste in **particle-public@particle-public.iam.gserviceaccount.com**. Choose **Pub/Sub Publisher** from the the "Select a role" dropdown. When you're done, click "Add." Congrats, you're all done!

## Enabling the Integration

### Particle Console

Now that you've done all of the pre-configuration required, you are now ready to enable the Google Cloud Platform integration
on the <a href="https://console.particle.io" target="_blank">Particle Console</a>.

Start by going to the integrations hub by clicking on the integrations icon in the sidebar (<i class="im-integrations-icon"></i>), or
by simply <a href="https://console.particle.io/integrations" target="_blank">following this link</a>. If you'd like to enable the integration
for a <a href="/guide/tools-and-features/console/#devices-vs-product-devices" target="_blank">product</a>, you'll need to visit the integrations
hub for the desired product. Do this by clicking the products icon (<i class="im-product-icon"></i>) in the sidebar, finding your product,
then clicking on the integrations icon (<i class="im-integrations-icon"></i>) in the product context.

Once in the integrations hub, click on the "New Integration" button. From the list of available integrations, click on "Google Cloud Platform."

<img src="/assets/images/new-gcp-integration.png"/>

You'll see a reminder that setup is required before continuing to enable the integration. If you have followed the steps outlined in
[Preconfiguration in Google Cloud Platform](#preconfiguration-in-google-cloud-platform), you should be good to go. Click the
"I have done all these things" button to advance.

The next step is configuring the integration. Fill out the following fields:
- **Event Name**: The name of the event that will trigger publishing an event to Google Cloud Platform. This is the name of your event when you call `Particle.publish()` in your firmware.
- **Google Cloud Pub/Sub Topic**: The name of your topic that you created in your Google Cloud Pub/Sub account. This topic forwards messages from a publisher (the Particle cloud) to subscribers.
The topic name is prefixed by `projects/{project_name}/topic/`.
- **Device**: Select which of your devices will trigger publishing to Google. If you'd like the publish to trigger from any of the devices you own, select 'Any.'
For product-level integrations, you can instead choose if you'd like the response to the integration to be routed back to the device in the fleet that originally triggered the publish.

<img src="/assets/images/gcp-configure-integration.png"/>

Click "Enable Integration." You have now successfully told the Particle cloud to stream data to Google Cloud Platform!
Make sure that the integration is configured properly by clicking on the **TEST** button.

<img src="/assets/images/test-integration.png"/>
<p class="caption">Clicking <strong>TEST</strong> will attempt to send a test event to the Google Cloud Platform Topic. This serves as a gut-check
to determine if the integration is configured successfully</p>

Did the test return a successful response? Great! Let's move onto firmware. If you can't get the test to succeed, double check that you used the correct
topic name, and that you gave the topic the correct permissions to allow Particle to publish to it on your behalf.

### Firmware

Now that the integration is enabled in the Particle cloud, the final step required to get data streaming into Google Cloud Platform
is to flash a device with some firmware that publishes the targeted event. Head over to the <a href="https://build.particle.io" target="_blank">Particle Web IDE</a>,
<a href="https://www.particle.io/products/development-tools/particle-local-ide" target="_blank">Local IDE</a>, or whichever IDE you are using for firmware development.

If you're already working on a firmware application, just make sure you include a `Particle.publish()` with the event name matching the event used to enable the
Google Cloud Platform integration above. Otherwise, if you need some sample firmware, paste in the below code into your firmware app:

```
// The on-board LED
int led = D7;

void setup() {
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}
void loop() {
  // Turn the LED Off
  digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
  // Publish an event to trigger the integration
  // Replace "my-event" with the event name you used when configuring the integration
  // Replace "test-data" with the real data you'd like to send to Google Cloud Platform
  Particle.publish("my-event", "test-data", PRIVATE);
  // Wait for 3 seconds
  delay(3000);
  // Turn the LED off
  digitalWrite(led, LOW);
  delay(3000);
}
```

The above code will publish an event every 6 seconds, when the on-board LED turns on.
In reality, you might publish an event containing the readings from
a temperature or humidity sensor every few minutes, when motion is detected, or when
a user interacts with the device by pushing a button. This firmware is entirely meant as
a sample to illustrate the minimum code needed to stream data into Google Cloud Platform.

Go ahead and flash the firmware with the `Particle.publish()` that will trigger the integration to
a Particle device.

Once confident in the firmware, you can stream data from large numbers of devices by
<a href="/guide/tools-and-features/console/#rollout-firmware" target="_blank">rolling out the firmware</a>
to a product fleet. Remember that this requires creating the integration under the product scope, allowing
any device in the product fleet to trigger the it.

Congrats! This is all you need to get the integration working end-to-end.
Your device will now begin to publish the targeted event, which will signal to
the Particle cloud to stream the contents of the event to Google Cloud Platform.

### Confirming the data reaches Google Cloud Platform

To ensure that the data is successfully being published to Google Cloud Platform, you can use the Google Cloud
CLI. To use the Google Cloud CLI, click on the terminal icon on the right side of
the top navigation bar as shown below:

<img src="/assets/images/gcp-cli-icon.png"/>

After launching the CLI, you can verify messages coming through by creating a _subscription_ to your Google Cloud
Pub/Sub topic name. Any other Google Cloud Platform product that you eventually use will also be subscribers
of your topic's messages. This subscriber, however, will just be use to acknowledge that messages are entering
Google Cloud Platform successfully.

To create a subscription:

```bash
~$  gcloud beta pubsub subscriptions create test_sub --topic [topic_name]
```

Where `topic_name` is the name of your Google Cloud Pub/Sub topic (don't include the `projects/{project_name}/topic/`
prefix, just the topic name). This subscriber will now listen for all messages published to your topic.

Now, to pull some published messages:

```bash
~$ gcloud beta pubsub subscriptions pull test_sub --auto-ack --max-messages 100
```

If things are looking good, you should see a table like this:
<img class="full-width" src="/assets/images/gcp-event-subscription-list.png"/>

Nice! Everything looks to be wired up correctly. We've proven that we are now successfully getting data from
a Particle device -> Particle Cloud -> Google Cloud Pub/Sub. From here, it's up to you how you'd like to leverage
Googe Cloud Platform's products & services to add value to your connected product. The rest of this tutorial will
focus on specific IoT use cases for Google Cloud Platform.

## Example Use Cases

### Storing Data in a Datastore Database

One relatively universal application of the Particle & Google Cloud Platform integration is the ability to store
device data into a long-term database. Google Cloud offers many different data storage options within the
platform, but this tutorial will show you how to get data into a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/datastore/" target="_blank">Google Cloud Datastore</a>.

Datastore is a NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling, high performance, and ease of application development. A key advantage of using
Datastore is the fact that its _schemaless_: this means it is flexible in the data structure it will accpet, and does not require configuration in advance.
Google Cloud Datastore also features high availability of reads and writes, massive scalability and performance, and automatic data encryption. For all of
Datastore's features, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/concepts/overview" target="_blank">check out the docs</a>.

Before starting with this tutorial, it is important that you first follow the setup steps above, both [preconfiguring in Google Cloud Platform](#preconfiguration-in-google-cloud-platform)
and [enabling the integration](#enabling-the-integration). We will be doing the following to successfully start storing data in Datastore:

1) Creating a subscription that will pull published messages from your Google Cloud Platform topic
2) Running a script to funnel messages into Datastore
3) Verifying that data is saved successfully
